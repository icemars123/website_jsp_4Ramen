                        <li><b>Locate safe areas of your house</b>, avoiding places with potential weapons (kitchen, garage) or small spaces without exits (bathroom with no windows).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Save useful <b>speed-dial</b> numbers:
                            <ul><br>
                                <li>Local police <b>000</b></li>
                                <li>Domestic Violence helpline <b>1800RESPECT</b></li>
                                <li>The number of a close friend, colleague, counsellor, family member that can act as witness or get you out of the situation</li></ul></li> 
                        <br>
                        <li>Have a <b>safe code word or phrase</b> that you have agreed with a close person (friend, family member, close colleague) to say that you need help by phone or message. Keep it simple and short, such as “Fire”, “Need groceries”, “Need milk”…</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Have a <b>protection/escape plan</b> in mind in case of emergency:
                            <ul><br>
                                <li>Keep important documents (ID cards, debit/credit card, driver’s licence, birth certificates, Medicare card, prescriptions, medicine, car keys) together in a safe place, in case you need them quickly</li>
                                <li>Have always some cash and your phone on you </li>
                                <li>A place where to go easy to reach</li>
                                <li>How to go there (friend’s lift, taxi, Uber, public transport)</li>
                                <li>Know where is the closest public telephone and memorise an emergency number</li></ul>
