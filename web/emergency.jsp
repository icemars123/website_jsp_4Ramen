            <p>Violence is not love. <br><br>
                Love means caring, supporting, understanding and respecting each other. <br><br>
                Violence means disrespect, mercilessness and possession; it starts with jealousy, cruelty and ends with revenge.  <br></p>

                <li>Subtle control, such as strongly encouraging you to dress a certain way.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Verbal abuse.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Abusers are used to deny their actions and responsibility. <br>After a dramatic event of violence they can change their behavior asking for forgiveness and promising love and respect. But such behavior is just a brief phase that makes harder for a woman to leave her abusive partner, but unfortunately it will fall again in frictions and then another violent explosion. <br><br>For this reason it is critical to recognize the typical signs of abusive relationships.<br><br>
