            <h2 class="story">Ann’s story</h2>
            <p class="story">I had been seeing this guy for just over three months. We both drank a lot. One night, he got really mad at me and he called me a lot of names, and then pushed me against the wall. I got really scared but he said he was sorry and he’d never do it again.</p>
            <p class="story">Another night, he wanted to make love and I asked him to put on a condom. He said he didn’t have one. I asked him to stop, and he wouldn’t. And he said that it didn’t matter, not to worry about it. At first, I sort of laughed cause i thought he was joking, but then I realized he was serious and I got scared. I told him to stop but he wouldn’t, and I pushed him away but he pushed me back and pinned me down with his body. He was very strong. He raped me.</p>


            <h2>How I coped</h2>
            <p>I had been abused as a child, and I had told him about it. I was very depressed already, and I had been cutting myself. Things got really bad after the rape. I tried to kill myself. I think I just wanted to cut myself really bad and I cut too deep, and I ended up nearly dead. They had to rush me to the hospital.</p>

            <h2>How the situation changed</h2>
            <p>I started to get counselling and had to deal with all the childhood abuse, and also all the alcohol and drugs I had done and all the people I had slept with. And also I talked about how much I’d cut myself, and burn myself. I was going crazy, and all I could think about was killing myself. I hated myself too. But getting counselling and a support group and getting anti-depressants really really helped.</p>

            <h2>What helped me</h2>
            <p>My sisters and my friends saved my life and I put them through hell. I didn’t really start to change until one night I felt with my BODY that I wasn’t to blame. I really was screwed up and doing the best I could. I realized that I had to forgive myself for some things, that I wasn’t to blame. And I realised that I would have to continue forgiving myself for my mistakes.</p>


            <h2>What I would say to others</h2>
            <p>Abuse doesn’t get better if you don’t do anything; it just keeps getting worse. You have to be your own friend. You have to have compassion for yourself. You have to forgive yourself. You deserve better. You are a precious human being and you deserve to be treated with respect. And you can’t ever give up. Don’t hurt yourself. Hang in there – you are not alone.</p>

            <h2 class="story">Katherine's Story</h2>
            <p class="story">I lived in a violent marriage for years. I was very naive at first and really didnt know people like him existed. He would kick me, slap me, push me, trip me over, throw things at me, stand on my feet, yell abuse, call me names like ‘social cripple’, the list goes on and on, but he never punched me.
                In fact he would say to people that he couldnt stand ‘wife bashers’. He would tell me that he didn’t want the children to play with so and sos children because they were a bad influence.</p>
            <p class="story">He tried to isolate us from all those who loved us and new people we met would go through character assasinations by him.
                Life was continous hell, fear and horror and he always blamed the children or me for his violence.
                Things got a lot worse towards the end. He would threaten to run us all off the road in the car and kill us. The violence became a daily occurance if not several episodes a day.</p>

            <h2>How I coped</h2>
            <p>Basically i coped by trying to keep him happy so he wouldnt do these things to us. I believed for a long time that it was my fault or the children’s. I cried a lot when he wasn’t home. I lost all my belief in myself. I was totally isolated and spoke to no one about what was happening. I dont think i really did cope except to hide it from the world and from myself.</p>

            <h2>How the situation changed</h2>
            <p>When his violence became much worse and was being directed at the children I changed. I began to read about self esteem and positive affirmations. I contacted a friend I used to know who worked in a Woman’s Centre and speaking to her made me realise we were not alone. Finally I began to see the reality of what was happening. When we left I believed he was going to kill us.</p>

            <h2>What helped me</h2>
            <p>The Domestic Violence Center women have helped me so very much. The support and understanding and sharing of experiences. Counselling, and I have done some violence recovery and self confidence courses. When the Family Court recognised what hell we went through and ordered absolute no contact for him with my children, was a big turning point in my healing. Good friends and family have been wonderful as well.</p>

            <h2>What I would say to others</h2>
            <p>If I could come and help you leave I would but it is you who has to do it. Leaving permanently is the only thing that will change the situation. You cant make him better no matter how much you love him. It is NOT your fault, it is his. You are a wonderful person and deserve so much better.
                You are not alone, there are many people who know what you are going through. Reach out to people and contact support groups like those who own this website, they are the experts. Most of all believe in yourself and know you are strong.</p>

            <h2 class="story">Julie's Story</h2>
            <p class="story">At first my boyfriend was so considerate, and overly friendly. Once we started dating he started to accuse me of cheating on him, and would call me a ‘slut’. He would repeatedly call to “check-up” on me. </p>
            <p class="story">When he say me dancing with a male friend, he grabbed my arm and I fell down a flight of steps trying to get away from him. One night, he held me down and wouldn’t let me leave his house.</p>
            <p class="story">The worst part was that I went along with everything. He would break up with me, and then I would take him back. He blamed me for his behavior, saying that if I was trustable, he wouldn’t have to check on me. He would ask my friends if I was trustworthy and would check to see if my car was at work.</p>
            <p class="story">Many times women believe that they would recognize abuse, I believed that.</p>
            <p class="story">I am an educated woman, from a good family, with a job, and a secure future. I never thought I would end up in an abusive relationship.
                It was so subtle – he stole my self worth.</p>

            <h2>How I coped</h2>
            <p>After we broke up, he started to stalk me. I made two police reports against him and took him to court for a restraining order. I didn’t get it. He followed me everywhere I went, sent lewd messages, threatened me. Six months later, he damaged my car. It has been a year, my friends have been a good support and a local abuse support service has helped</p>

            <h2>How the situation changed</h2>
            <p>I avoid places I know he goes. About every couple months he sends a lewd message, but I have been able to return to a normal life. I am careful about going places by myself. I have finally realized that I am not all the things he called me, and that I am lovable. I am in a healthy relationship now that is full of respect.</p>

            <h2>What helped me</h2>
            <p>He had convinced me that I was crazy and unlovable. I started going to the support service and became educated on the cycle of abuse. I saw so clearly that it wasn’t my fault. A support group has shown me that I am not alone. Friends have stuck by me- they were there-they saw what happened.</p>

            <h2>What I would say to others</h2>
            <p>It is so easy to deny. I did not want to admit that I could be in an mentally abusive relationship – I wanted to believe that he loved me. If friends and family tell you that there is something wrong with your relationship – really look at what they are saying. Don’t give up your freedom or your self-worth.
                You deserve to be happy and to feel good about your self. It may be hard to leave – but it will always be worth. Don’t be afraid to seek legal help or counselling. You are worth it!
